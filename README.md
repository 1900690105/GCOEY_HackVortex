## 🚨 Problem Statement

The job market today is plagued by a widening skill gap. Over 20 lakh B.Tech graduates emerge each year, but only 20–30% are deemed industry-ready. Employers face severe hiring issues due to mismatched skills, and outdated job preparation methods leave candidates unprepared. There is no personalized guidance, no AI-driven support, and no effective way for students to align their skills with industry needs.
